## About

Unfortunately Authenticator exports its verification codes in a proprietary QR Code.

Sometimes we want to import these codes into anther software, but many programs can't read Authenticator's QR Codes.

This app was created so you can read Authenticator's QR Codes and export the verification codes to any other app. This app will generate the original QR Codes for these accounts.

## Getting Started

This a Flutter App, if you want to run it yourself, please check [how to install Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).

This app is only compatible with Android.

This app doesn't store or transmit any of your data, it can work offline.

The algorithm was inspired by [this node.js project](https://github.com/krissrex/google-authenticator-exporter).
